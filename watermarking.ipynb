            "(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. \"The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,\" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. \"I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,\" he said in a statement last week. \"From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about.\" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.\n",

            "Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people \"don't care about health care reform.\" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and \"drama\" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a \"fired-up and ready to go\" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.\n",

            "(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

            "One in every 13 people on the planet check Facebook the moment they wake up - leading to reports of Facebook addiction and social anxiety. And, according to one researcher, the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network. Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a plug-in to remove all metrics, including likes and share numbers, from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user’s enjoyment. Scroll down for video . Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a browser plug-in to automatically remove all metrics from Facebook, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. The vast number of metric is shown ringed in red . The browser plug-in can be installed to Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It automatically removes all metrics from the site, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. ‘Over the last few decades, we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement, a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective,’ said Mr Grosser from the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Grosser. ‘Within the context of Facebook, however, this culture of audit plays out differently. Mr Grosser said that over the past decade, web users have become increasingly measured and audited. Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.\n",

'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure.

The 33-year-old's contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the 2016-17 season . 'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden.. 'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.' Casillas admits that winning their 10th European Cup has taken the pressure off Real Madrid . The legendary keeper began his career at the Bernabeu as a 16-year-old . The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS. 'Where we are now is we have our national-team players here, and quality Latin players have always been in the league, but the category that has grown most is the name players that are coming,' Gulati told WSJ.\n",

            "Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year. Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday. Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership . Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins. 'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies. 'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by. Peter Pavlett (left) wheels away after scoring the winner in Aberdeen's recent 1-0 defeat of ICT . 'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible. 'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.' Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) has attracted strong interest from a number of Premier League sides . 'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.' Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil. A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries. A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax. 'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.' ends .\n",

The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors \"was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge\" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. \"He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,\" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. \"I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,\" he said. \"There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English.\" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. \"He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,\" he added.\n",

            "By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant. The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present. He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court. Rapper Joe Budden, pictured who has appeared in court after being accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage . However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him. He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free. 'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added. Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop . He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend. According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard. Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her. A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’ The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack. TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating. The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head. New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.' The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation. Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men . The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club. He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down. In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue. In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.\n",

            "Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer. Swath pets in sweaters stitched with gingerbread men and Christmas trees and they could win worst-dressed at those seasonal ugly sweater parties popular with people. Icy paws no more: PetSmart is selling leg warmers for dogs, saying it's a throwback to the 1980s . PetSmart also is selling leg warmers online and in stores from Top Paw and Luv-A-Pet. 'STAR WARS' GEAR . Dogs will 'use the force' with Petco's line of 'Star Wars' toys and clothing. Dress up dogs like Princess Leia with a headband sporting her signature bun hairstyle. The Death Star won't menace when it comes as a treat dispenser ($7.49) or tug-of-war toy ($5.99). Plush squeaker toys feature favorite characters — R2-D2, Chewbacca and Darth Vader — for less than $10. And don't forget the cats — the Millennium Falcon flies at the end of a teaser toy string for less than $5. DEVICES FOR OLDER DOGS . Make it easier for your senior dog to get around safely with equipment from Solvit Pet Products (www.solvitproducts.com ). Help them avoid injury in the car with a Department of Transportation-tested safety harness ($30) and ease their way out of the vehicle with a ramp for those who can no longer jump ($159). Keep them close on a bike ride with a bicycle trailer or stroller ($399) or with a wicker basket ($89). GOURMET FARE . After romping in the snow, pets can warm up with San Diego-based Honest Kitchen's Winter Warmers Broths. Just add hot water to the dehydrated mixes in chicken consomme, beef and bone, and turkey stock flavors. The company, which focuses on natural food good enough for people's palates, offers the $19.99 three-box sets for a limited time.

            "Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.\n",

            "By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.\n",

            "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. \"It's still history,\" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. \"The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know.\" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. \"We love him,\" Altermese Beale says of Obama. \"One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected.\" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. \"There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,\" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. \"If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,\" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. \"It's like a spark,\" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. \"When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' \" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. \"You hear a lot of talk about suppression,\" he says. \"Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also.\" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, \"Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' \" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. \"We have more at stake,\" Burton said. \"We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%.\" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. \"We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,\" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. \"The president could do more in that area,\" Johnson said. \"When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done.\" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. \"The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,\" Johnson said. \"I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.\"\n",

The posts also claim Fatma was beaten by her employer and deprived of food. According to ABS-CBN News, she was scalded after her employer's mother in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, became enraged at the time it was taking to brew coffee. A tussle ensued, which led to Fatma being covered in the freshly boiled water. The Facebook post read: 'This is my cousin, who works as domestic helper in Riyadh, Saudi . Arabia.

            "By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying. 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15. Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say \"wow your eyelashes look really nice\" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads. 'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another. If only! Actress Sofia Vergara fronts Covergirl's latest campaign (pictured) which claims the mascara delivers ten times 'more noticeable lashes' <script type='text/javascript' src='http://v9.anv.bz/scripts/anv_mcp_9.js'>var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 358; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS');Other reviewers describe the product as containing 'glue' and resembling 'tar'. MailOnline counted 13 instances in which customers specifically reported lost lashes and the mascara currently has a two out five score on the website. A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.' 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara' The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes. Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.\n",

            "He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax. Return fares with Eurostar cost from £69 per person (03432 186 186; www.eurostar.com). Tickets to the Musee Picasso (Hôtel Salé, 5 rue de Thorigny; 0033 1 8556 0036; www.museepicassoparis.fr) cost 11€.\n",

            "(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims \"was marred with unprecedented election fraud.\" \"Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,\" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were \"unsubstantiated\" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. \"Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory.\" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. \"We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,\" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. \"The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,\" he said. \"It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies.\" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. \"Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,\" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. \"The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.\"\n",

            "The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '\"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'\n",

            "A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'\n",

            "Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In \"The Politician,\" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. \"The Politician\" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that \"the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms.\" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. \"After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' \" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. \"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?\" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. \"I am Quinn's father,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.\" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. \"While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,\" his attorneys wrote. \"From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention.\" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. \"Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,\" her publisher Random House said in a statement. \"It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. \"She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. \"Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say.\" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. \"After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,\" Young writes. \"A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. \"My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family.\" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a \"naked pregnant woman\" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in \"a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks\" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured \"it was safe to assume it was Rielle.\" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was \"irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'\" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a \"Made in the USA\" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he \"loved Cracker Barrel\" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry \"just wasn't all that smart.\" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.\n",

            "(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. \"The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,\" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. \"I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,\" he said in a statement last week. \"From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about.\" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.\n",

            "Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people \"don't care about health care reform.\" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and \"drama\" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a \"fired-up and ready to go\" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.\n",

            "(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

            "One in every 13 people on the planet check Facebook the moment they wake up - leading to reports of Facebook addiction and social anxiety. And, according to one researcher, the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network. Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a plug-in to remove all metrics, including likes and share numbers, from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user’s enjoyment. Scroll down for video . Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a browser plug-in to automatically remove all metrics from Facebook, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. The vast number of metric is shown ringed in red . The browser plug-in can be installed to Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It automatically removes all metrics from the site, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. ‘Over the last few decades, we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement, a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective,’ said Mr Grosser from the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Grosser. ‘Within the context of Facebook, however, this culture of audit plays out differently. Mr Grosser said that over the past decade, web users have become increasingly measured and audited. Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.\n",

            "Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off against Cordoba for punching, kicking and slapping defenders . Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has once again stated his desire to play in the MLS once his glittering career at the Bernabeu is over. The Spain international has spent his entire career with Los Blancos after being handed his debut as a 16-year-old and his current contract expires in 2017. 'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure. Real Madrid No 1 Iker Casillas can see himself playing in the US at the end of his career . The Spain international looks to the skies during Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat of Cordoba . The 33-year-old's contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the 2016-17 season . 'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden.. 'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.' Casillas admits that winning their 10th European Cup has taken the pressure off Real Madrid . The legendary keeper began his career at the Bernabeu as a 16-year-old . The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS. 'Where we are now is we have our national-team players here, and quality Latin players have always been in the league, but the category that has grown most is the name players that are coming,' Gulati told WSJ.\n",

            "Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year. Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday. Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership . Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins. 'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies. 'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by. Peter Pavlett (left) wheels away after scoring the winner in Aberdeen's recent 1-0 defeat of ICT . 'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible. 'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.' Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) has attracted strong interest from a number of Premier League sides . 'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.' Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil. A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries. A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax. 'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.' ends .\n",

            "A rare letter written by Napoleon Bonaparte in English will go to the auction block in France on Sunday. The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors \"was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge\" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. \"He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,\" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. \"I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,\" he said. \"There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English.\" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. \"He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,\" he added.\n",

            "By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant. The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present. He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court. Rapper Joe Budden, pictured who has appeared in court after being accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage . However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him. He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free. 'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added. Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop . He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend. According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard. Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her. A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’ The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack. TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating. The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head. New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.' The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation. Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men . The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club. He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down. In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue. In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.\n",

            "Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer. Swath pets in sweaters stitched with gingerbread men and Christmas trees and they could win worst-dressed at those seasonal ugly sweater parties popular with people. Icy paws no more: PetSmart is selling leg warmers for dogs, saying it's a throwback to the 1980s . PetSmart also is selling leg warmers online and in stores from Top Paw and Luv-A-Pet. 'STAR WARS' GEAR . Dogs will 'use the force' with Petco's line of 'Star Wars' toys and clothing. Dress up dogs like Princess Leia with a headband sporting her signature bun hairstyle. The Death Star won't menace when it comes as a treat dispenser ($7.49) or tug-of-war toy ($5.99). Plush squeaker toys feature favorite characters — R2-D2, Chewbacca and Darth Vader — for less than $10. And don't forget the cats — the Millennium Falcon flies at the end of a teaser toy string for less than $5. DEVICES FOR OLDER DOGS . Make it easier for your senior dog to get around safely with equipment from Solvit Pet Products (www.solvitproducts.com ). Help them avoid injury in the car with a Department of Transportation-tested safety harness ($30) and ease their way out of the vehicle with a ramp for those who can no longer jump ($159). Keep them close on a bike ride with a bicycle trailer or stroller ($399) or with a wicker basket ($89). GOURMET FARE . After romping in the snow, pets can warm up with San Diego-based Honest Kitchen's Winter Warmers Broths. Just add hot water to the dehydrated mixes in chicken consomme, beef and bone, and turkey stock flavors. The company, which focuses on natural food good enough for people's palates, offers the $19.99 three-box sets for a limited time. Puppy love: In this undated photo provided by Solvit Pet Products, people push their  dog in a bicycle trailer with strolling kit and their dog seems to be enjoying sticking his head out of the wondow .

            "Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.\n",

            "By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.\n",

            "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. \"It's still history,\" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. \"The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know.\" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. \"We love him,\" Altermese Beale says of Obama. \"One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected.\" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. \"There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,\" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. \"If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,\" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. \"It's like a spark,\" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. \"When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' \" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. \"You hear a lot of talk about suppression,\" he says. \"Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also.\" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, \"Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' \" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. \"We have more at stake,\" Burton said. \"We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%.\" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. \"We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,\" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. \"The president could do more in that area,\" Johnson said. \"When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done.\" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. \"The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,\" Johnson said. \"I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.\"\n",

Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say \"wow your eyelashes look really nice\" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads. 'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another. If only! Actress Sofia Vergara fronts Covergirl's latest campaign (pictured) which claims the mascara delivers ten times 'more noticeable lashes' <script type='text/javascript' src='http://v9.anv.bz/scripts/anv_mcp_9.js'>var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 358; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS');Other reviewers describe the product as containing 'glue' and resembling 'tar'. MailOnline counted 13 instances in which customers specifically reported lost lashes and the mascara currently has a two out five score on the website. A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.' 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara' The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes. Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.\n",

            "He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax. Return fares with Eurostar cost from £69 per person (03432 186 186; www.eurostar.com). Tickets to the Musee Picasso (Hôtel Salé, 5 rue de Thorigny; 0033 1 8556 0036; www.museepicassoparis.fr) cost 11€.\n",

            "(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims \"was marred with unprecedented election fraud.\" \"Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,\" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were \"unsubstantiated\" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. \"Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory.\" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. \"We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,\" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. \"The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,\" he said. \"It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies.\" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. \"Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,\" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. \"The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.\"\n",

            "The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '\"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'\n",

            "A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'\n",

            "Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In \"The Politician,\" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. \"The Politician\" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that \"the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms.\" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. \"After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' \" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. \"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?\" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. \"I am Quinn's father,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.\" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. \"While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,\" his attorneys wrote. \"From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention.\" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. \"Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,\" her publisher Random House said in a statement. \"It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. \"She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. \"Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say.\" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. \"After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,\" Young writes. \"A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. \"My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family.\" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a \"naked pregnant woman\" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in \"a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks\" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured \"it was safe to assume it was Rielle.\" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was \"irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'\" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a \"Made in the USA\" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he \"loved Cracker Barrel\" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry \"just wasn't all that smart.\" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.\n",

            "(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. \"The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,\" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. \"I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,\" he said in a statement last week. \"From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about.\" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.\n",

            "Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people \"don't care about health care reform.\" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and \"drama\" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a \"fired-up and ready to go\" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.\n",

            "(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

            "One in every 13 people on the planet check Facebook the moment they wake up - leading to reports of Facebook addiction and social anxiety. And, according to one researcher, the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network. Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a plug-in to remove all metrics, including likes and share numbers, from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user’s enjoyment. Scroll down for video . Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a browser plug-in to automatically remove all metrics from Facebook, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. The vast number of metric is shown ringed in red . The browser plug-in can be installed to Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It automatically removes all metrics from the site, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. ‘Over the last few decades, we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement, a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective,’ said Mr Grosser from the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Grosser. ‘Within the context of Facebook, however, this culture of audit plays out differently. Mr Grosser said that over the past decade, web users have become increasingly measured and audited. Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.\n",

Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has once again stated his desire to play in the MLS once his glittering career at the Bernabeu is over. The Spain international has spent his entire career with Los Blancos after being handed his debut as a 16-year-old and his current contract expires in 2017. 'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure. Real Madrid No 1 Iker Casillas can see himself playing in the US at the end of his career . The Spain international looks to the skies during Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat of Cordoba . The 33-year-old's contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the 2016-17 season . 'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden.. 'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.' Casillas admits that winning their 10th European Cup has taken the pressure off Real Madrid . The legendary keeper began his career at the Bernabeu as a 16-year-old . The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS. 'Where we are now is we have our national-team players here, and quality Latin players have always been in the league, but the category that has grown most is the name players that are coming,' Gulati told WSJ.\n",

            "Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year. Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday. Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership . Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins. 'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies. 'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by. Peter Pavlett (left) wheels away after scoring the winner in Aberdeen's recent 1-0 defeat of ICT . 'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible. 'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.' Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) has attracted strong interest from a number of Premier League sides . 'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.' Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil. A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries. A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax. 'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.' ends .\n",

The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors \"was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge\" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. \"He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,\" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. \"I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,\" he said. \"There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English.\" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. \"He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,\" he added.\n",

            "By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant. The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present. He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court. Rapper Joe Budden, pictured who has appeared in court after being accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage . However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him. He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free. 'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added. Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop . He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend. According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard. Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her. A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’ The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack. TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating. The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head. New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.' The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation. Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men . The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club. He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down. In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue. In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.\n",

            "Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer. Swath pets in sweaters stitched with gingerbread men and Christmas trees and they could win worst-dressed at those seasonal ugly sweater parties popular with people. Icy paws no more: PetSmart is selling leg warmers for dogs, saying it's a throwback to the 1980s . PetSmart also is selling leg warmers online and in stores from Top Paw and Luv-A-Pet. 'STAR WARS' GEAR . Dogs will 'use the force' with Petco's line of 'Star Wars' toys and clothing. Dress up dogs like Princess Leia with a headband sporting her signature bun hairstyle. The Death Star won't menace when it comes as a treat dispenser ($7.49) or tug-of-war toy ($5.99). Plush squeaker toys feature favorite characters — R2-D2, Chewbacca and Darth Vader — for less than $10. And don't forget the cats — the Millennium Falcon flies at the end of a teaser toy string for less than $5. DEVICES FOR OLDER DOGS . Make it easier for your senior dog to get around safely with equipment from Solvit Pet Products (www.solvitproducts.com ). Help them avoid injury in the car with a Department of Transportation-tested safety harness ($30) and ease their way out of the vehicle with a ramp for those who can no longer jump ($159). Keep them close on a bike ride with a bicycle trailer or stroller ($399) or with a wicker basket ($89). GOURMET FARE . After romping in the snow, pets can warm up with San Diego-based Honest Kitchen's Winter Warmers Broths. Just add hot water to the dehydrated mixes in chicken consomme, beef and bone, and turkey stock flavors. The company, which focuses on natural food good enough for people's palates, offers the $19.99 three-box sets for a limited time. Puppy love: In this undated photo provided by Solvit Pet Products, people push their  dog in a bicycle trailer with strolling kit and their dog seems to be enjoying sticking his head out of the wondow .

            "Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.\n",

            "By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.\n",

            "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. \"It's still history,\" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. \"The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know.\" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. \"We love him,\" Altermese Beale says of Obama. \"One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected.\" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. \"There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,\" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. \"If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,\" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. \"It's like a spark,\" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. \"When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' \" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. \"You hear a lot of talk about suppression,\" he says. \"Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also.\" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, \"Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' \" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. \"We have more at stake,\" Burton said. \"We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%.\" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. \"We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,\" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. \"The president could do more in that area,\" Johnson said. \"When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done.\" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. \"The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,\" Johnson said. \"I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.\"\n",

            "By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying. 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15. Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say \"wow your eyelashes look really nice\" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads. 'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another. If only! Actress Sofia Vergara fronts Covergirl's latest campaign (pictured) which claims the mascara delivers ten times 'more noticeable lashes' <script type='text/javascript' src='http://v9.anv.bz/scripts/anv_mcp_9.js'>var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 358; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS');Other reviewers describe the product as containing 'glue' and resembling 'tar'. MailOnline counted 13 instances in which customers specifically reported lost lashes and the mascara currently has a two out five score on the website. A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.' 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara' The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes. Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.\n",

            "He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax. Return fares with Eurostar cost from £69 per person (03432 186 186; www.eurostar.com). Tickets to the Musee Picasso (Hôtel Salé, 5 rue de Thorigny; 0033 1 8556 0036; www.museepicassoparis.fr) cost 11€.\n",

            "(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims \"was marred with unprecedented election fraud.\" \"Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,\" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were \"unsubstantiated\" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. \"Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory.\" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. \"We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,\" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. \"The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,\" he said. \"It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies.\" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. \"Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,\" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. \"The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.\"\n",

            "The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '\"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'\n",

            "A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'\n",

            "Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In \"The Politician,\" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. \"The Politician\" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that \"the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms.\" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. \"After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' \" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. \"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?\" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. \"I am Quinn's father,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.\" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. \"While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,\" his attorneys wrote. \"From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention.\" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. \"Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,\" her publisher Random House said in a statement. \"It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. \"She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. \"Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say.\" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. \"After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,\" Young writes. \"A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. \"My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family.\" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a \"naked pregnant woman\" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in \"a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks\" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured \"it was safe to assume it was Rielle.\" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was \"irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'\" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a \"Made in the USA\" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he \"loved Cracker Barrel\" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry \"just wasn't all that smart.\" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.\n",

            "(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. \"The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,\" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. \"I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,\" he said in a statement last week. \"From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about.\" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.\n",

            "Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people \"don't care about health care reform.\" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and \"drama\" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a \"fired-up and ready to go\" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.\n",

            "(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

            "One in every 13 people on the planet check Facebook the moment they wake up - leading to reports of Facebook addiction and social anxiety. And, according to one researcher, the fault lies with the little red notification icons and the numbers that litter the social network. Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a plug-in to remove all metrics, including likes and share numbers, from the site – and discovered that their removal improved a user’s enjoyment. Scroll down for video . Software expert Benjamin Grosser recently created a browser plug-in to automatically remove all metrics from Facebook, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. The vast number of metric is shown ringed in red . The browser plug-in can be installed to Chrome, Firefox and Safari. It automatically removes all metrics from the site, including likes, shares, comments, number of events, group notifications, friend requests and numbers, message count and more. ‘Over the last few decades, we have become increasingly subject to mechanisms of measurement, a constant push to assess performance from a quantitative perspective,’ said Mr Grosser from the School of Art and Design, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Grosser. ‘Within the context of Facebook, however, this culture of audit plays out differently. Mr Grosser said that over the past decade, web users have become increasingly measured and audited. Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.\n",

            "Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off against Cordoba for punching, kicking and slapping defenders . Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has once again stated his desire to play in the MLS once his glittering career at the Bernabeu is over. The Spain international has spent his entire career with Los Blancos after being handed his debut as a 16-year-old and his current contract expires in 2017. 'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure. Real Madrid No 1 Iker Casillas can see himself playing in the US at the end of his career . The Spain international looks to the skies during Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat of Cordoba . The 33-year-old's contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the 2016-17 season . 'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden.. 'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.' Casillas admits that winning their 10th European Cup has taken the pressure off Real Madrid . The legendary keeper began his career at the Bernabeu as a 16-year-old . The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS.

            "Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year. Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday. Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership . Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins. 'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies. 'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by. Peter Pavlett (left) wheels away after scoring the winner in Aberdeen's recent 1-0 defeat of ICT . 'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible. 'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.' Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) has attracted strong interest from a number of Premier League sides . 'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.' Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil. A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries. A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax. 'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.' ends .\n",

The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors \"was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge\" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. \"He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,\" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. \"I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,\" he said. \"There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English.\" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. \"He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,\" he added.\n",

            "By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant. The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present. He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court. Rapper Joe Budden, pictured who has appeared in court after being accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage . However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him. He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free. 'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added. Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop . He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend. According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard. Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her. A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’ The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack. TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating. The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head. New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.' The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation. Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men . The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club. He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down. In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue. In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.\n",

            "Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer. Swath pets in sweaters stitched with gingerbread men and Christmas trees and they could win worst-dressed at those seasonal ugly sweater parties popular with people. Icy paws no more: PetSmart is selling leg warmers for dogs, saying it's a throwback to the 1980s . PetSmart also is selling leg warmers online and in stores from Top Paw and Luv-A-Pet. 'STAR WARS' GEAR . Dogs will 'use the force' with Petco's line of 'Star Wars' toys and clothing. Dress up dogs like Princess Leia with a headband sporting her signature bun hairstyle. The Death Star won't menace when it comes as a treat dispenser ($7.49) or tug-of-war toy ($5.99). Plush squeaker toys feature favorite characters — R2-D2, Chewbacca and Darth Vader — for less than $10. And don't forget the cats — the Millennium Falcon flies at the end of a teaser toy string for less than $5. DEVICES FOR OLDER DOGS . Make it easier for your senior dog to get around safely with equipment from Solvit Pet Products (www.solvitproducts.com ).

            "Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.\n",

            "By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.\n",

            "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. \"It's still history,\" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. \"The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know.\" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. \"We love him,\" Altermese Beale says of Obama. \"One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected.\" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. \"There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,\" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. \"If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,\" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. \"It's like a spark,\" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. \"When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' \" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. \"You hear a lot of talk about suppression,\" he says. \"Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also.\" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, \"Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' \" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. \"We have more at stake,\" Burton said. \"We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%.\" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. \"We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,\" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. \"The president could do more in that area,\" Johnson said. \"When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done.\" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. \"The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,\" Johnson said. \"I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.\"\n",

            "By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying. 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15. Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say \"wow your eyelashes look really nice\" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads. 'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another. If only! Actress Sofia Vergara fronts Covergirl's latest campaign (pictured) which claims the mascara delivers ten times 'more noticeable lashes' <script type='text/javascript' src='http://v9.anv.bz/scripts/anv_mcp_9.js'>var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 636; p.config.height = 358; p.loadVideoExpressV3('eyJ1cGxvYWRfaWQiOiJleHByZXNzLTE0MDE4OTY0MjI3MTEiLCJ2aWRlb190eXBlIjoiMSIsInNyY19pbWFnZV91cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vc2hhcmluZy5hYmMxNS5jb20vc2hhcmV3cHR2L3Bob3RvLzIwMTQvMDYvMDMvV1BUViBNYXNjYXJhXzE0MDE4MzI1MDAyNTFfNTg3NjcyOF92ZXIxLjBfNjQwXzQ4MC5qcGciLCJkZWZfdGl0bGUiOiJNYXNjYXJhIiwidGl0bGUiOiJNYXNjYXJhIiwiZGVmX2RlY3NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIiwicHVibGlzaGVkX3VybHMiOlt7ImZvcm1hdCI6Im1wNDsiLCJlbWJlZF91cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vc2hhcmluZy5hYmMxNS5jb20vc2hhcmV3cHR2L3ZpZGVvL3ZpZGVvX3N0dWRpby8yMDE0LzA2LzAzL01hc2NhcmFfMTY2ODgzLm1wNCIsInByb3RvY29sIjoibXA0OyIsImNkbl9uYW1lIjoiQWthbWFpIiwia2JwcyI6NTAwfV0sImNhcHRpb25zIjpbeyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6ImVuIiwiZm9ybWF0IjoiREZYUCIsInVybCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9zaGFyaW5nLmFiYzE1LmNvbS9zaGFyZXdwdHYvdmlkZW8vdmlkZW9fc3R1ZGlvLzIwMTQvMDYvMDMvY2FwdGlvbnMvTWFzY2FyYV8xNjY4ODMwMDAwLmRmeHAifV0sInRzX3B1Ymxpc2hlZCI6IjIwMTRfMDZfMDMifQ==|1000011|SPS');Other reviewers describe the product as containing 'glue' and resembling 'tar'.

A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.' 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara' The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes. Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.\n",

            "He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax. Return fares with Eurostar cost from £69 per person (03432 186 186; www.eurostar.com). Tickets to the Musee Picasso (Hôtel Salé, 5 rue de Thorigny; 0033 1 8556 0036; www.museepicassoparis.fr) cost 11€.\n",

            "(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims \"was marred with unprecedented election fraud.\" \"Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,\" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were \"unsubstantiated\" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. \"Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory.\" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. \"We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,\" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. \"The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,\" he said. \"It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies.\" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. \"Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,\" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. \"The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.\"\n",

            "The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '\"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'\n",

            "A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'\n",

            "Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In \"The Politician,\" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. \"The Politician\" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that \"the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms.\" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. \"After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' \" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. \"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?\" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. \"I am Quinn's father,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.\" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. \"While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,\" his attorneys wrote. \"From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention.\" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. \"Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,\" her publisher Random House said in a statement. \"It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. \"She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. \"Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say.\" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. \"After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,\" Young writes. \"A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. \"My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family.\" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a \"naked pregnant woman\" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in \"a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks\" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured \"it was safe to assume it was Rielle.\" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was \"irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'\" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a \"Made in the USA\" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he \"loved Cracker Barrel\" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry \"just wasn't all that smart.\" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.\n",

            "(CNN) -- A Florida high school valedictorian and her sister, who were facing deportation, instead were meeting with with lawmakers Wednesday after being granted a reprieve. An immigration judge ruled last week that Daniela Pelaez, 18, and her sister Dayana were to be deported for being in the country illegally. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday gave the sisters a two-year reprieve. The decision was made under the policy of prosecutorial discretion, which is designed to prioritize deportation for illegal border crossers with a criminal record, instead of those who pose little or no risk. \"The agency exercises prosecutorial discretion, on a case by case basis, as necessary to focus resources on our stated priorities,\" ICE spokesman Nestor Yglesias said in a statement Wednesday. The Pelaez sisters traveled to Washington to meet with Florida Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, and Florida Reps. David Rivera and Frederica Wilson. Rubio, a Republican, had expressed support for finding a way for Daniela Pelaez to remain in the United States. \"I have always said that our country needs to figure out a way to accommodate high academic achievers brought here at a very young age by their parents but who now find themselves undocumented through no fault of their own,\" he said in a statement last week. \"From what I've read in press accounts, the story of Daniela Pelaez is exactly the kind of case I have been talking about.\" The sisters and their parents came from Colombia 14 years ago and never left -- overstaying their tourist visas. A Miami immigration judge ruled last week that the two girls must be deported to Colombia, leaving the teenagers in shock. Daniela, a high school senior, has a 6.7 grade point average and is at top of her class out of 823 students, a school administrator said. The teenager wants to study cellular and molecular biology for a medical career.\n",

            "Editor's note: Erica Williams is deputy director of Campus Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes. She works to engage the millennial generation and communities such as people of color, women and people of faith in the political process. She can be found at ericawilliamsonline.com and on Twitter at @ericawilliamsdc. Erica Williams says the idea that young people don't care about the health care issue is wrong. (CNN) -- As Congress returns to Capitol Hill, back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform, one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock: the voice of young Americans. Just Thursday, there were more than 880,000 Facebook status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform, generated organically and spread virally from young people and other Facebook users across the country. Some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people's engagement in the debate despite the common, and categorically false, notion that young people \"don't care about health care reform.\" Young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population, and two-thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007, according to research for the Commonwealth Fund. More than half of all young adults have low incomes (below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, $21,660 for a single person in 2009), and low-income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher-income young adults, according to the Urban Institute. And contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured, 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full-time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers. Millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign, according to the Rock the Vote Poll of 18- to 29-year-olds, conducted in February 2008 by Lake Research Partners. Whether it is the 25-year-old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who can't purchase insurance in the individual market, the 20-year-old line cook who doesn't receive insurance through her job or the 28-year-old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums, young Americans experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis. Nevertheless, despite a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey showing that 60 percent of Americans aged 18 to 34 support Obama's reform plan, the voice of young Americans has been strikingly absent from the public, televised national debate. And that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform. Young Americans have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result, and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative (the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do). Without their voices, the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older Americans who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo, despite all signs that it is rapidly failing. Young people were such a vital force during the election, not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them. And what could be more needed now? But if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate, why the silence? Why does it appear as if young people aren't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future? Well, if we are gauging America's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling, screaming and death panel-ing at some town halls, no wonder we think young people don't care. Those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and \"drama\" in its politics. Or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a \"fired-up and ready to go\" base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls. Obama rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender. Or what about the fact that the president's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent's plan, rather than the current limit of 19 for those who don't attend college? This is what young people should have been told. But it isn't too late. As 2008 showed, young people, like all other constituencies, speak when spoken to. As the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle, President Obama has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along. It is beyond time for the White House, and other organizers working to support reform, to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found, both on- and offline, and empower them to make their voices heard. In the meantime, young people are doing it themselves. Students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums, designing health care T-shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials. They are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track. In order to succeed, the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm, support and perspective of young people. And time is running out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Erica Williams.\n",

            "(CNN) -- The current chaos in Iraq is tragic in almost every way. In retrospect, it is easy to conclude Iraq was not nearly ready enough to assume control of its own security situation when the United States made the decision to withdraw forces in December 2011. The wisdom of that decision will long be debated, but having made it, the United States is now understandably reluctant to undo it. Even as the Obama administration sorts through a galaxy of unattractive options, none of which is guaranteed to provide stability, it would be well-advised not to overlook one of the biggest strategic lessons of the Iraqi deterioration. That would be the warning signal it provides for another country headed down the same disturbing path: Afghanistan. While Iraq and Afghanistan are of course vastly different in terms of demographics, history and terrain, the parallels emerging between them in terms of security implications and political process are too important to ignore. An extremist militant group rising quickly and taking over large swaths of the country. A government focusing more on retribution and vengeance than reconciliation and governance. And a supposedly well-trained army essentially disintegrating in the face of real conflict. All of these characteristics describe the situation in Iraq, but all may be equally descriptive of Afghanistan in only a few short years. Similar to Iraq, Afghanistan has an ethnic, well-organized and well-funded insurgent group poised to retake significant amounts of territory once U.S. troops leave. There can be no doubt that the Taliban, having seized power once before in Kabul, is only biding its time until it can do so again. Much like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Taliban takes advantage of the limits of federal influence and governs by fear and aggression. It is only a matter of time before the Taliban, newly emboldened by the recent prisoner swap that freed five militants, takes control of southern Afghanistan and challenges Kabul's authority. Compounding this situation is the shaky and corrupted political process under way, which makes Iraq look like a well-functioning democracy. In a variation of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's sectarian tendencies, outgoing Afghan President Hamid Karzai has done little to unite Afghanistan's many tribal factions during his 12 years in office, instead often fomenting discontent. While both of the leading presidential candidates have pledged to focus on unity, there is little reason to believe that either will make it a priority. Ominously, one candidate has already boycotted the electoral process before the results of the June 14 run-off election even being announced. As a result, Afghanistan could become even more politically divided than Iraq is today. Perhaps the biggest wild card in Afghanistan's future is the Afghan National Army. Much like the Iraqi army, the Afghan army will be charged with maintaining the security situation once the United States departs. And much like the Iraqis, the Afghans have been trained by the United States. As we heard in Iraq, the training of the Afghans will be sufficient preparation to defend the country from any threats that may arise. While the Afghans may be courageous soldiers, there have been numerous reports of lackluster performances. So much so that their abilities in actual combat situations remain uncertain. In addition, Afghanistan has never had a real national fighting force, meaning there are few examples and fewer role models for current soldiers to emulate. As a national army, the Afghans came from a much less mature and much less professional starting point than the Iraqis. As illustrated in Iraq, without the right training and leadership, soldiers may not be willing to defend against insurgents, despite an enormous numerical advantage. Given all this, it is not difficult to look at the situation in Iraq and see Afghanistan's future. Indeed, with a resurgent Taliban, political instability in Kabul, an untested army and if the United States continues with its plan to drawdown forces at the end of 2014, especially without an agreement in place for the retention of American security personnel, a future similar to Iraq's may be inevitable. However, unlike Iraq, this bleak Afghan future need not necessarily become reality. The United States still has an opportunity to avoid making the same mistakes it made in Iraq. To accomplish this, the United States needs to redouble its efforts at training the Afghan army to develop it into a legitimate fighting force. It needs to put diplomatic pressure on the new president as soon as he takes office to embark on a unification and reconciliation process. And most important, it needs to plan for a withdrawal based on appropriate benchmarks and conditions, not on a political timetable. Such a change in strategy would undoubtedly be domestically unpopular. But sometimes, unpopularity is a necessary price for avoiding a far worse alternative in the future.

Typically, this self-surveillance involved either a few watching the many, known as panoptic surveillance, or the many watching the few, dubbed synopticon. Instead today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ said Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. ‘It is no longer a form of self-surveillance where the few watch the many, or the many watching the few. Instead, today’s social network-based culture of audit is more similar to ‘the many watching the many,’ where everyone watches everyone else.’ Mr Grosser said that this creates a new mode of surveillance known as graphopticon. ‘While one Facebook user can’t know if their friend count is being observed at any one moment, they know that any number of users could be looking at any moment,’ continued Mr Grosser. ‘Their Timeline is open to all of their friends, and in many cases to all of the world. Therefore, he said users need to appear to have multiple likes, shares and friends to look more popular. This need for numbers is also influenced by how Facebook’s News Feed is organised. The more a user interacts with likes, comments, and other objects, the higher the News Feed algorithm rates those posts, and thus shows them on the news feeds of their friends. More interaction leads to more visibility. Visibility therefore becomes a prerequisite for getting more likes, shares, and friends. Mr Grosser discovered that Facebook is designed as an ‘endless interaction loop’ which draws on the user’s need for more likes, shares and comments. A user clicks the red number to read the notification, but this causes the metric to disappear. The left-hand image shows how likes and share metrics appear. The right-hand image reveals how the site looks after the Demetricator plug-in has been enabled. Research has revealed metrics create an 'interaction loop of checking', similar to compulsive behaviour, but this is manageable when numbers are removed . Similarly, this image reveals how the site looks when the metrics are removed, without removing the names or other details from posts. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers . The quickest way to then get new notifications is to post statuses or comments that attract attention, or by adding friends. And the more content and posts a user makes, the higher the potential for likes, shares and comments. ‘This interaction loop of checking, reading, and generating resembles compulsive behaviour in the way that it sets up a cycle that can never be satisfied,’ said Mr Grosser. Mr Grosser said metrics on the social network end up homogenising Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they Liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. ‘The user’s desire for more craves higher notification metrics, but the system’s design clears those metrics every time the user checks them. ‘In the case of notifications, metrics want more attention from the site’s users.’ He continued that these numbers also homogenise Facebook users because individual thoughts and ideas are combined into a single number, and whole groups of friends are reduced into a value. Equally, individuals become lumped together as a group, because they liked the same product or page. And by making people all appear the same, they strive to stand out from the crowd by posting more statuses and comments. By removing the metrics, Mr Grosser found that people were less competitive, anxious and preoccupied with the numbers. One user said: ‘[Facebook is] so much more enjoyable without constant (subconscious) pressure to compare when numbers are involved,’ while another said ‘[Notifications] simply became a nervous addiction for me, inadvertently. ‘But, that all changed when I downloaded the add-on. ‘No more ridiculous liking stats, no more mounds of notifications or the number of comments on other’s statuses. 'It added a Zen element to the entire format, and I finally feel at ease.’ Mr Grosser’s paper ‘What do metrics want? How quantification prescribes social interaction on Facebook’, is published in the journal Computational Culture.\n",

Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas has once again stated his desire to play in the MLS once his glittering career at the Bernabeu is over. The Spain international has spent his entire career with Los Blancos after being handed his debut as a 16-year-old and his current contract expires in 2017. 'I have no problem saying that I would like to play in the US,' Casillas told The Wall Street Journal without putting any timescale on his departure. Real Madrid No 1 Iker Casillas can see himself playing in the US at the end of his career . The Spain international looks to the skies during Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat of Cordoba . The 33-year-old's contract at the Bernabeu expires at the end of the 2016-17 season . 'This has been a tough past year and a half, but it has made me tougher mentally. At the club level, Real Madrid winning lifted a huge burden.. 'We'd been 12 years without winning [Champions League] and we're lucky that we've won many titles recently when there had been 30 or so years when Real Madrid hadn't won. That took the pressure off us and helped us move forward.' Casillas admits that winning their 10th European Cup has taken the pressure off Real Madrid . The legendary keeper began his career at the Bernabeu as a 16-year-old . The 33-year-old has publicly expressed his intention to leave Real when his contract expires and wants to move to a different league because he cannot see himself playing against his club. US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati would relish the opportunity of bringing a world-class player like Casillas to the MLS. 'Where we are now is we have our national-team players here, and quality Latin players have always been in the league, but the category that has grown most is the name players that are coming,' Gulati told WSJ.\n",

            "Ronny Deila insists he does not care if Celtic edge the title by a single point – so long it's part of a domestic Treble. The Parkhead side find themselves embroiled in a title joust for the first time in three years, with second placed Aberdeen just two points behind going into the New Year. Expected to romp to four-in-a-row, the champions lost to Dundee United and only managed a home goalless draw with bottom club Ross County on Saturday. Celtic manager Ronny Deila insists he isn't concerned how his side win the Scottish Premiership . Conceding it would be 'unthinkable' to surrender the championship, Deila admitted he would settle for limping over the line by the slenderest of margins. 'If we win the Treble – yes,' he said. 'I don't care if it's one point or ten points as long as we win the Treble. 'It's all about trophies. No-one asks how many points do you win by, it's all about trophies. 'That's always been the case in history. You never remember who is No2 or how many points you win by. Peter Pavlett (left) wheels away after scoring the winner in Aberdeen's recent 1-0 defeat of ICT . 'Aberdeen are getting better and are on a good run – we will see in the end how many points they get and we can get. A challenge could be a positive thing for the league but we want to win as many things as possible as soon as possible. 'I think it's important to have experience of a title race and to know what is expected of you to win things.' Accepting Celtic are engaged in a genuine title dogfight for the first time since the financial collapse of Rangers, the Norwegian said he understands the importance of retaining the title. 'Of course, I say it all the time – winning the league is the most important thing here and that's what we are aiming to do,' he said. It was a feisty affair with tempers flaring on both sides as bottom side Ross County held Celtic on Saturday . 'I'm totally aware about the demands for the league – that's from everyone here at the club. 'The mentality is to win and we are leading. We are ahead and if we win by 20 points that's good but the most important thing is to win. 'I think it's a transitional period. You have to compare us with the team in the first year of the previous manager. 'It's not fair to judge me against last season, If I can be here for four years then hopefully I can keep going and get a better and better team. 'We are top of the league and fighting for every single trophy in this country and still in Europe but I'm totally aware of the pressures to win the league and that's the most important thing.' Leigh Griffiths lies dejected on the floor after a missed opportunity in the 0-0 draw with Ross County . Aberdeen face St Johnstone at Pittodrie tomorrow with the chance to go top before Celtic kick-off at 5.30pm against Partick Thistle at Firhill. Deila believes the Pittodrie side are equipped to put his side under pressure. 'They have consistency and they won a trophy last year. They are a big club and of course they have a chance,' he explained. 'But we have to do everything we can to make sure they can't cope with it. 'We can't do anything about Aberdeen or Dundee United. We just have to win games and go on a run of good games. 'If you take the last 10 games, they have been good. But two haven't been good and we have to get back on track again and get the three points against Partick Thistle. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk (left) has attracted strong interest from a number of Premier League sides . 'If we keep doing that it is going to be tough to follow us.' Celtic, meanwhile, have been linked with a move for Ajax defender Stefano Denswil. A Dutch under-21 international Denswil has been told he can leave the Amsterdam Arena as a free agent this summer, with Dutch newspapers claiming the Parkhead side and Juventus have made early enquiries. A potential replacement if Virgil van Dijk goes in January, Denswil's agent Winny Haatrecht said: 'Stefano's preference is basically to finish the season with Ajax. 'If he is still playing at the beginning of March then Ajax might change their mind.' ends .\n",

            "A rare letter written by Napoleon Bonaparte in English will go to the auction block in France on Sunday. The letter could fetch close to $100,000 in the auction in the French town of Fontainebleau, south of Paris. Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors \"was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge\" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. \"He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him,\" Chataigner said. The auctioneer said Napoleon picked up English relatively quickly and well. \"I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written,\" he said. \"There are very few mistakes apart from a few words which have two meanings in English.\" Napoleon learned the language in two or three years, Chataigner said. \"He's really a very good student, although he was a good student in lots of fields so it's maybe not that surprising,\" he added.\n",

            "By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Rapper and reality TV star Joe Budden has appeared in court to face charges that he viciously beat his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage outside a New York restaurant. The 33-year-old Pump It Up singer turned himself into police on Wednesday when he attended the 34th Precinct station house in Inwood, Manhattan with his lawyer present. He was later arraigned on charges of assault, grand larceny and robbery in Manhattan Criminal Court. Rapper Joe Budden, pictured who has appeared in court after being accused of viciously beating up his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage . However, according to the Daily News, the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew member was later released after his mother posted the $10,000 bail needed to free him. He told them as he left the courthouse: 'It's good to be free. 'I’ve been portrayed worse by better,' he added. Career trajectory: Budden is a member of the Slaughterhouse hip hop crew and a star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop . He was also ordered to sign an order of protection forbidding him from contacting the ex-girlfriend. According to police, Budden forced the 25-year-old woman into his car near the corner of Nagle Avenue and Dyckman Street in Queens at around 4.30am last Monday and then smashed her head into the dashboard. Budden then allegedly drove the woman to his home in New Jersey, where he proceeded to punch and kick her. A source close to the woman told the website MediaTakeOut that Budden ‘choked her to the point she thought he was going to kill her…. She said the look on his face was dreadful like he had no soul.’ The rapper also allegedly snatched the victim’s cell phone before the attack. TMZ has obtained graphic photos allegedly showing the aftermath of the beating. The snapshots depict the victim's legs and arms covered in black and blue bruises, as well as red marks on her neck and the back of the head. New York Post's Page Six reported the star of VH1's Love and Hip Hop flew into a rage after seeing photos of his former girlfriend on Instagram  with other men in a nightclub. The rapper has responded to the scandal through his attorney, Nima Ameri, who said in a statement to TMZ that his client 'looks forward to an opportunity to responsibly deal with and address the allegations so he may establish the actual facts.' The lawyer added that the reality TV star is co-operating with the investigation. Under guard: The 33-year-old shared this image on Instagram of himself surrounded by a trio of massive dogs, writing in the caption that he was guarded, 'literally' Hearsay: According to the victim's friend, the woman had her head smashed on a dashboard, kicked, punched and choked by Budden, who flew into a rage after seeing her spending time with other men . The rapper has continued to be active on Twitter since the allegations surfaced and last Saturday morning even posted pictures on Instagram from a strip club. He also directed his ire at the New York Police Department via social after it sent out his picture and asked the public for help tracking him down. In one expletive-punctuated tweet, the New York City native said he was going to sue. In another, he tells the NYPD's account to alert the 'Man hunt' that he'll be at an Astoria strip club tonight.\n",

            "Pet owners looking to launch the next online sensation or just longing for a new view of their dog's dashing and digging won't have to shop for long to find the perfect holiday gift. Wrap up a dog harness that holds any durable, wearable camera and watch Frisbee fetch, lazy lap naps and every memory in between come alive. GoPro Inc.'s Fetch dog harness fits over Fido's chest or back and holds the small, waterproof camera known for attaching to helmets, surfboards, cars and wrists to film rugged adventures. Sony, Garmin and Kurgo also make camera mounts for dogs. The device is among a legion of gifts that retailers have rounded up for pet wish lists this year. Narrowing it down is tough, but the harness tops the more unique options and creates footage that lasts. Doggone awesome: A dog wearing two GoPro cameras, one on his back and one on his chest is  held on by what is known as a Fetch dog harness . Bark up someone's else's tree: Thor, a French bulldog, wears what is marketed as an 'ugly' sweater, created by Bret Michaels for his Pets Rock Line . The most pet-friendly camera in the GoPro Inc. line is the Hero4, which allows people to decide what the dog records and control all the functions with a touch screen, company spokeswoman Kelly Baker said. The camera sells for $399, and the mount costs $59. The chest harness captures bone-chewing and digging, while the back mount films running and jumping, Baker said. They adjust to fit dogs weighing 15 to 120 pounds. The canine camera view has proved popular. A video went viral of an eager Labrador strapped with a camera sprinting through trees and across rocks to an Italian beach, where it leaps into the ocean. John Duffield of Santa Monica, California, loves the footage he got from the GoPro he mounted on his two dogs. He got enough shots to make a short video shortly before his chow-Labrador-Akita mix, Lupa, died. But Duffield didn't strap the camera to his Chihuahua, Pup, three months ago when he and his wife brought their newborn daughter home from the hospital. 'Pup is like a member of the family, too,' Duffield said. 'He belonged in this picture because he was welcoming home part of his family.' Those looking for pet gifts besides the traditional treats, new bowls and beds can give something unexpected such as: . UGLY SWEATERS . They are the rage this year, so PetSmart Inc. will hawk ugly sweaters for cats and dogs from Bret Michaels' Pets Rock line ($15.99), said Shelly Albrecht, spokeswoman for the national retailer. Swath pets in sweaters stitched with gingerbread men and Christmas trees and they could win worst-dressed at those seasonal ugly sweater parties popular with people. Icy paws no more: PetSmart is selling leg warmers for dogs, saying it's a throwback to the 1980s . PetSmart also is selling leg warmers online and in stores from Top Paw and Luv-A-Pet. 'STAR WARS' GEAR . Dogs will 'use the force' with Petco's line of 'Star Wars' toys and clothing. Dress up dogs like Princess Leia with a headband sporting her signature bun hairstyle.

            "Two California teachers who were arrested on allegations of engaging in sexual encounters on the beach with their male high school students will not be charged with sexual assault. However, South Hills High School teachers Melody Lippert, 38, and Michelle Ghirelli, 30, both from Covina, were each charged yesterday with one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after allegedly providing alcohol to students. They could face a maximum sentence of one year in jail if convicted. Prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence to file sexual assault charges. Scroll down for video . Melody Lippert (left), 38, and Michelle Ghirelli (right), 30, both from Covina, were arrested last month over sexual assault allegations, but will not be charged for sexual assault. However they were each charged on one misdemeanor count of contributing to the delinquency of a minor . As the investigation continues, Lippert and Ghirelli could also face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations, according to the LA Times. The teachers were arrested on January 17, with Lippert on charges of conspiracy and contributing to the delinquency of a minor while Ghirelli was charged with copulation and unlawful sex with a minor. They were both released after posting bail and currently remain on paid administrative leave. The teachers from South Hills High School could possibly face additional charges as investigators look into other allegations (the school pictured above) 'The Covina-Valley Unified School District is shocked by the Orange County District Attorney's decision with regards to the charges filed. 'However, we recognize that the investigation is continuing and additional charges could be forthcoming,' spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said in a written statement. 'As teachers and administrators who work closely and in a trusted position with children, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. 'We are subject to the Education Code and our Board policies and as such, we will continue with our own investigation and have created our own draft statement of charges for dismissal, which will be delivered to both individuals.' Source: San Gabriel Valley Tribune . Lippert, who has taught as a teacher for the Covina-Valley Unified School District for 15 years, had met up with a group of male students from her high school at a beach in San Clemente last November, on a trip that was not school sponsored, according to CBS. In initial reports, Lippert had reportedly given the group alcohol and then engaged in a sexual act with one of the students, according to deputies. She then made plans to meet up with the students for a second liaison at the same spot, bringing along Ghirelli, who has been teaching for the district for five years. The pair then met up with five students of the same group on a non-school sponsored camping trip from December 27 to 29, spending a night on the beach. The teachers are set to be arraigned on Friday morning at the Harbor Justice Center. The district has also launched an investigation into the incident. It has also reportedly began the process of firing Lippert and Ghirelli, along with three other employees who have been accused of violating district policies.\n",

            "By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 29 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 29 September 2013 . Atlantis was buried beneath the waves by a cataclysm aeons ago. Addicts of Seventies’ TV will know the cataclysm had a name: Patrick Duffy. The Man From Atlantis was a sci-fi drama featuring Duffy, future star of the Texas soap opera Dallas, as the last survivor of that mythical submerged city. He had webbed feet and gills, and he could live off seaweed at the bottom of the ocean. Action packed: Atlantis promises to be a romp through Greek fables . The problem was, Duffy’s acting was so wooden that he floated. The Man From Atlantis was washed up after one series. Keen to avoid any confusion with this disastrous prototype, the producers of BBC1’s new family adventure serial, Atlantis, have changed everything. Atlantis isn’t an undersea kingdom, for a start — it’s a hot and dusty walled city on a Greek island. The hero Jason doesn’t have gills. In fact, he is half drowned when the story starts: half drowned and completely naked. Just as the Beeb’s previous Saturday evening serial, Merlin, tended to have King Arthur and his knights shirtless, Atlantis star Jack Donnelly is going to be spending a lot of time bare-chested. This is family entertainment, after all, and Mum needs to be entertained as much as anyone. Merlin was a wild romp through British fables and legends, and Atlantis promises to treat Greek myths in the same cavalier fashion. Great viewing: We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour . Within minutes, Jason was fighting off a two-headed dragon, dodging arrows fired by the city guards and being rescued by a mathematician and a demigod — Pythagoras and Hercules. The show gets away with it because hardly anyone knows more than a few fragments of the original tales. In Victorian times it was very different: the myths were treated as serious historical accounts. Only 225 years ago, Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary dated Jason and the Argonauts to 1263BC, placing the Labours of Hercules four decades later. Mind you, Dr Lempriere calculated that the world had been created in exactly 4004BC. Even his Dictionary, however, didn’t believe in Atlantis: ‘Its situation is unknown,’ he said, ‘and its existence is doubted.’ Potential: Their sketch show was promising, the question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out . So the producers of this big-budget show are free to mix history, legend and wild imagination on a gigantic scale, and they take full advantage. We had romance, sword fights, supernatural beasts, prophets, mad kings, daring princesses and lashings of humour. Mark Addy, best known to fantasy fans for his role in Game Of Thrones as King Robert Baratheon, played Hercules with a Yorkshire accent. Robert Emms was the nerdy Pythagoras, prone to panicking and shouting things like: ‘They’ve released the hunting lions!’ The pace faltered only when the seeress Juliet Stevenson was grimacing and rolling her eyes, serving up her Mystic Oracle with thick slices of ham. Don’t mind her. She’ll probably get better with practice. Carry . On veteran Leslie Phillips saucily recalled, in his Portrait, on More4, . that when he worked with Laurence Olivier in the Forties, the great . actor was secretly gay. Larry’s male lover was ‘English, one of the best actors you could get,’ Leslie confided. Whoever could he mean? Atlantis has brought high jinks and family fun back to Saturdays. It promises to be unmissable, as Justin Molotnikov, who directed the first three episodes, explains. ‘Even I don’t know where the story is heading,’ he told me. ‘The actors were running from one set to another, filming different sequences, even different episodes, and it all comes together in post-production like a massive jigsaw. ‘I could read the scripts and find out. I could demand to see the future episodes. But I chose not to… because I want to watch it fresh. I want to keep it special, to sit and watch it on a Saturday with my kids.’ Also making their debut this weekend were the stars of the Edinburgh comedy festival, Graeme Rooney, Paul Charlton and Kevin O’Loughlin, in The Ginge, The Geordie And The Geek (Sunday, BBC2). Their sketch show was promising. It had seagulls mugging chip shops, Bletchley Park cypher-breakers trying to decode the female mind and a ventriloquist’s doll that was planning to elope with another puppeteer. The question is whether they can maintain the laughs when their stage material runs out.And they should do something about that abysmal name — at least change it to the Three-Gees.\n",

            "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Paulette Beale shakes her head at the suggestion, then flashes a contagious smile. \"It's still history,\" she says, to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for President Barack Obama in the African-American community the second time around. \"The first history was that he won. The second history's that he won twice. So, it's not just about history the first time, you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also. You can make history more than one time, you know.\" Her mother and father stand a few feet away, nodding approvingly. Paul and Altermese Beale founded Paul Beale's Florist 41 years ago. Paulette takes the lead now, but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the Ogontz Avenue area of North Philadelphia. \"We love him,\" Altermese Beale says of Obama. \"One of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected.\" The Beales are determined to see the president re-elected, and are part of an Obama campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big African-American turnout that was critical to then-Sen. Obama's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds, Pennsylvania among them. Our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president's speech to the National Urban League. At that meeting, in New Orleans, a major topic of discussion is a new Urban League study suggesting that if African-American turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels, then Obama is almost certain to lose North Carolina and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds, including Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. In 2008, just shy of 65% of eligible African-Americans voted for president; in 2004 it was 60%. That prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the African-American vote, an eye-popping 95% in 2008. There are a number of reasons the Obama campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to Philadelphia: . • Economy: African-American unemployment is well above the national average. • History: The prospect of electing the country's first African-American president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost. • Complacency: The president's win in Pennsylvania was by 9 points, and Republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988. • New voter ID laws: Pennsylvania is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on Election Day. Paul Beale scowls at the mention of the law. \"There are people who don't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote,\" he says. Altermese Beale says some of her elderly friends don't have driver's licenses or other current photo identification. \"If they keep this law, we will be in bad shape,\" she says. The Beales ask every customer if they are registered to vote, and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help. Across the street at the Obama campaign field office -- one of six in Philadelphia -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements. The campaign's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with African-American voters. Danny Wright is a natural fit. A 67-year-old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native Maryland and now the owner of Danny's Auto Tags, which contracts with the state to issue driver's licenses and also sells auto insurance. \"It's like a spark,\" Wright told us during our afternoon visit. \"When you say, 'Obama,' everybody is very, very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person, 'Have you registered to vote?' \" The new ID law is also a hot topic of conversation. Many fiercely oppose it. Wright is in that group, but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through November. \"You hear a lot of talk about suppression,\" he says. \"Everyone is making sure they're having the proper ID and everything to go vote. So we reinforce this also.\" Our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an October feel than late July; campaign volunteers were everywhere, asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. One of the local Obama turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign. Most of the others took shape beginning a year ago. One older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him, \"Don't worry, Pennsylvania is a can't-lose.' \" Bruce Burton has a quick answer when visitors to his Pretty Boyz barber shop sound complacent about the president's November odds. \"We have more at stake,\" Burton said. \"We're either going back to the years of President Bush or we're going to keep moving forward. ... We have voter registration forms in the back. We are recruiting as many people as possible. We are not feeling that this is a sure bet. We feel we have to stand behind him 100%.\" Black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this, and Dr. Kevin R. Johnson says Obama can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president's support for same-sex marriage. \"We understand that he is not the pastor of the United States of America -- he is the president of the United States,\" said Johnson, the senior pastor at Philadelphia's Bright Hope Baptist Church. After services this past Sunday, Bright Hope congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter ID law. Johnson says that law could be one factor in driving African-American turnout down a bit from 2008. But if there is a significant drop, his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force. \"The president could do more in that area,\" Johnson said. \"When you look at the unemployment rate in the African-American community, there's more that can be done.\" Still, Johnson says things are a bit improved in recent months, and as he tells congregants they must vote, he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate. \"The reason I know that everything is going to be all right in November is because I trust in the Lord,\" Johnson said. \"I love the president. But I trust in the Lord.\"\n",

            "By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A woman has claimed that Covergirl's two-step Bombshell Volume mascara is so hard to get off, it caused her to lose a significant clump of eyelashes in trying. 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand', Amy Schavolt, 21, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, tells ABC15. Ms Schavolt was initially impressed with the dramatic results she achieved from the mascara, which Covergirl boasts delivers 'ten times more noticeable lashes vs. bare lashes'. Noticeable indeed! Amy Schavolt claims Covergirl's Bombshell Volume mascara was so hard to get off - even with make-up remover - that she wrenched out a sizable clump of her lashes in trying (pictured) Product fail: Ms Schavolt (pictured) says she was initially impressed with the bold effects of the mascara, but it quickly turned into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' before it caused her lashes to fall out . 'I had a couple of people say \"wow your eyelashes look really nice\" and I was all excited', she says, insisting that she applied the product exactly as instructed; two layers of the 'extreme volume' base coat and two layers of the 'intensifying' top coat. The product quickly transformed into a 'clumpy, gooey mess' however, and disaster struck when Ms Schavolt tried to remove the product with make-up remover. Dr Alan Bauman, a specialist in repairing damaged eyelashes was shown photos of Ms Schavolt's missing clump and deemed her lashes 'traumatized'. 'Eyelashes can take some time to rebound. It can take like two to four months', he told the news outlet, advising consumers to be extra gentle when removing tough products like this one. Shocking: 'I was wiping downward with the cotton ball and noticed a chunk of my eyelashes fell into the palm of my hand' Ms Schavolt (pictured) explains . Alarmingly, Ms Schavolt is not the only one in her predicament. Plenty of other customers have made the same complaint in their reviews of Covergirl's Bombshell volume on the brand's own website. 'Dear God someone tell me how to get this mascara OFF!' writes one reviewer. 'WORST PURCHASE EVER! I'M PANICKING!' 'No amount of make-up remover would remove. Pulled out half of my lashes trying to get it off', another reads. 'As a former model, I always turned to Cover Girl cosmetics first when looking for make-up... It is extremely hard to remove and I lost clumps of my eyelashes trying!' rants yet another. If only!

MailOnline counted 13 instances in which customers specifically reported lost lashes and the mascara currently has a two out five score on the website. A statement Covergirl issued to Ms Schavolt reads: 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara. We have performed extensive testing on the product to ensure its safety and effectiveness and significant lash fall out is not typical.' 'Covergirl Bombshell Mascara wears like a waterproof, and therefore it can be more difficult to remove than a regular mascara' The representative advised customers to remove it using an oil-based eye make-up remover and allow it sit on the lashes 'for about a minute' before 'gently' wiping it away. Countless reviewers however claim to have followed these instructions and still lost lashes. Covergirl mailed Ms Schavolt a coupon for a future purpose, and it seems unlikely she will spend it on mascara - if she wants to keep the rest of her lashes, that is.\n",

            "He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax. Return fares with Eurostar cost from £69 per person (03432 186 186; www.eurostar.com). Tickets to the Musee Picasso (Hôtel Salé, 5 rue de Thorigny; 0033 1 8556 0036; www.museepicassoparis.fr) cost 11€.\n",

            "(CNN) -- Malaysia's opposition leader has urged his supporters to wear black at a rally to be held in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday to protest Sunday's vote, which he claims \"was marred with unprecedented election fraud.\" \"Our conscience cannot allow us to accept election results conjured through frauds and cheating. A fight for clean and fair election remains the single most important fight that any Malaysian should relate to,\" Anwar Ibrahim said in a statement released Monday. Prime Minister Najib Razak, the leader of the Barisan Nasional coalition that has ruled for 56 years, took his oath of office on Monday after winning 133 out of 222 parliamentary seats, Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported. Anwar's Pakatan Rakyat coalition won 89 seats, handing Barisan Nasional its worst ever electoral showing. A government spokesperson said on Tuesday that allegations of fraud in the election process were \"unsubstantiated\" and the government's victory was in line with independent polling. \"Anwar claimed the only way he could possibly lose was if there was 'massive fraud',\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"This is entirely contrary to pre-election opinion polls, including those by Pew Research and the Merdeka Center, which showed significant support for both the Prime Minister and his ruling party and suggested they were on track for a victory.\" The weeks leading up to Sunday's election saw reports of firebombs, texted death threats and beatings and there were widespread reports that indelible ink used to mark the fingers of advance voters was washing off. Other allegations surfaced on polling day, with Anwar's party and election observers alleging the government exchanged cash for votes and flew in foreigners to cast their ballots in favor of Barisan Nasional -- a charge denied by the government. \"We were told that 40,000 foreigners were being flown across Malaysia to vote. However, passenger manifests prove that a few hundred Malaysian citizens were flown to their home states, entirely legally,\" it said in a statement. Investors reacted favorably to the election outcome, sending Malaysia's stock index up more than 8% on Monday and strengthening the currency. Liam Hanlon, senior political analyst at Cascade Asia Advisors, said the government should interpret its reduced margin of victory as a warning from voters that reform is needed. \"The government must heed this warning and understand that it needs to be more forward-looking in order to survive,\" he said. \"It would be a shame if the opposition's strong showing actually propelled the country back into more pronounced race-based policies.\" In the 1970s, Malaysia introduced policies that effectively split the country along ethnic lines, giving preferential treatment to the so-called Bumiputera, or ethnic Malays and natives of Sarawak and Sabah. According to the CIA Factbook, just over 50% of the country is Malay. Chinese make up 23.7% and Indians 7.1%. Anwar appealed to voters with a promise to change race-based policies to make them more inclusive and needs-based. James Chin, a professor of political science at the Malaysian campus of Australia's Monash University, said the results showed that Malaysia's ethnic Chinese population had voted in a bloc against the government for the first time. He added that some urban Malays had also voted for the opposition. He said that Anwar's efforts to address election irregularities would depend on whether he drew support from across Malaysia's multi-ethnic population. \"Elections in Malaysia have never really been free and fair but the big difference this time was for the first time in Malaysian history, the Chinese on both sides of the South China Sea voted together against the government,\" he said, referring to Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. \"The key to tomorrow's attendance is to see if the Malays are willing to come out. If only the Chinese come out it will look like a racial protest. It needs to be a multiracial protest if it's going to have any effect.\"\n",

            "The legal high known as ‘hippy crack’ was used by one in 16 young people, according to new figures. The first data to be released on the use of nitrous oxide reveals more than six per cent, or 350,000  people aged 16-24 year used the drug last year. Better known as laughing gas, it is a regular fixture as a legal party and festival drug and is the second most popular drug among young people. Legal high: Discarded Nitrous Oxide canisters and balloons used for inhaling abandoned in campsites at the Glastonbury Festival . On a downer: Illegal drug use has fallen, particularly for cocaine and ecstasy, latest figures show . Nitrous oxide is inhaled to make people feel euphoric and relaxed - but drug experts warn it can cause death on first time use through suffocation. For the first time the 2012-13 Crime Survey for England and Wales included questions about the use of the drug. It is often sold to recreational users in balloons in nightclubs and at parties. Cheap, seemingly harmless and guaranteeing a night of raucous laughter, so-called 'hippy crack' is increasingly popular with celebrities and their well-heeled young fans alike. Home office minister Jeremy Browne said drug use in England and Wales was at a record low . Even Prince Harry was seen indulging two years ago. The survey also asked participants about herbal high salvia, also known as Mexican magic mint. It found that some 6.1 per cent of . adults aged 16 to 24 had taken nitrous oxide, while 1.1 per cent had . taken salvia in the last year. However overall drug use in England and Wales is at the lowest level since records began. The Home Office reported that around 8.2 per cent of 16 to 59-year-olds used an illicit drug in the last year, compared with 11.1 per cent in 1996. And the proportion of adults who took a class A drug has dropped from 3 per cent in 2011-12 to 2.6 per cent. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne wrote to summer festival organisers earlier this year highlighting the Government's concerns about the availability of nitrous oxide and asking that they take steps to prevent its sale at events. Today Mr Browne said: ‘Today’s report shows drug usage in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. ‘This, coupled with the record number of people leaving drug treatment programmes free from dependency, is really positive news.’ A survey on attitudes also revealed that almost four out of five - or 79 per cent- of respondents thought taking cannabis was unsafe. Two-thirds thought it was never acceptable to take cannabis and the majority said it was unsafe to take heroin, cocaine or ecstasy. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Nitrous . oxide is a legal substance which has a number of legitimate medical and . industrial uses but any suggestion of abuse, particularly by young . people is of concern. '\"Like all drugs there are health risks and nitrous oxide should not be experimented with.'\n",

            "A regiment of soldiers from a pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One. The Birkenhead Bantams were formed in November 1914 after the Wirral town's MP Alfred Bigland successfully petitioned for men of short stature to be allowed to enlist. Bigland's petition to the War Office led to the minimum height for soldiers in the Army to be lowered from five foot three inches, to just five foot. The pint-sized battalion has been honoured 100 years after they volunteered for service in World War One . As a result thousands of men who had been refused the chance to serve their country, were able to fight in the Great War. The Bantams, who were renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, served in bloody battles including at Ypres and The Somme. By the end of the war in 1918, more than 900 officers and soldiers from the regiment had lost their lives fighting for Queen and country. A plaque has been unveiled at Birkenhead Town Hall, in Cheshire, and shows that 2,200 undersized recruits had joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' with four days of the war office reducing the minimum height for soldiers . MP Alfred Bigland's campaign to lower the minimum height for soldiers gained lots of media attention at the time, with newspapers such as the Daily Sketch featuring the petition (pictured) The Bantam battalions were first recruited in Cheshire following MP Alfred Bigland's petition, after he heard of a group of miners that had been  rejected from every recruiting office on account of their size. Soon renamed the 15th and 16th Battalions, Cheshire Regiment, the Bantams undertook gruelling training and served in some of the most hard fought battles of the war including  Ypres and The Somme. During WWI, two whole divisions, the 35th and the 40th, were formed from Bantams and tragically were virtually annihilated during the Battle of Ypres. Heavy casualties and the introduction of conscripted men of all heights eventually led to Bantam unit becoming indistinguishable from other regiments. The unit's centenary was marked at Birkenhead Town Hall attended by the Lord Lieutenant of Merseyside, veterans and members of the Armed Forces. A plaque was unveiled revealing that 2,200 undersized recruits joined the 1st and 2nd 'Bigland's Birkenhead Bantams' in just four days. Mayor of Wirral Cllr Steve Foulkes said: 'Birkenhead Town Hall has seen many important events but few can match the significance of those that unfolded in these very rooms exactly 100 years ago today. 'The story of those brave Birkenhead Bantams and their part in the history of the Great War is awe inspiring, and we owe them a debt we can never repay. 'We can, however, remember them, and make sure that their bravery and sacrifice is never forgotten - which is why this memorial and events such as this are so important.'\n",

            "Sitting in the casualty department of one of the best-known hospitals in Britain, I can’t help but notice it’s packed to the rafters. Yet it’s not a hectic Saturday night, but a Monday lunchtime at the beginning of December and everyone seems sober. Despite this, I struggle to find a seat, even though it is obvious I’m in deep shock and on the point of passing out in agony. This is by far the worst pain I’ve ever suffered. I know my upper arm is broken — I fell off a step and heard the crack — and fully expect at least a four-hour wait. A woman having a cigarette outside warned me as I arrived: ‘Hope you’ve set aside the whole day. I’ve been waiting ages!’ Jenni Murray (pictured) fell off a step and broke her arm, she was treated at North London's Royal Free Hospital . As I look around the crowd, I see little evidence of painful injury. I ask the woman next to me what she’s come for — a headache, no less. ‘No point calling the GP. You can never get seen,’ she says. It’s the same story with the worried-looking father a few rows back. With a feverish young son lying listlessly on his lap, he explains he came straight to the hospital. He didn’t even think to start with his GP. It’s clear evidence that casualty is becoming the first port of call whether it’s an accident, emergency or just feeling a bit poorly. No wonder the staff at the Royal Free Hospital in North London look so strained. My worries about a long wait are mercifully unfounded — obviously, a genuine crisis is attended to as a priority. Within 20 minutes I see a triage nurse and am sent for an X-ray. A broken humerus is confirmed and I’m sent home wearing a sling with the hope the break is clean and will begin to mend. I’m to see the consultant the following week in the fracture clinic. So far, for a badly injured woman in her 60s, so good. It’s been a long time since I was an emergency case. It was the early Nineties. I’d slipped down a set of stairs and not so much broke, as demolished, my ankle. I recall a quick consultation, instant admission, pins and screws and a two-week stay with good care. But, as I was to discover, it’s a very different story now. I’ve always been a staunch supporter of the NHS, a service that was introduced just two years before my birth in 1950, and made all the difference in the world to my parents’ peace of mind. For the first time in their lives, they didn’t have to worry about paying for the inoculations — polio, diphtheria and smallpox — that were now available to every child, free of charge. It never occurred to me to consider private medicine as I got older. I had my two sons on the NHS and received kind, attentive and sympathetic care before, during and after birth. When I was diagnosed with breast cancer nearly ten years ago, I was given a speedy referral by an excellent GP and instant admission for a mastectomy into The Christie Hospital in Manchester. The surgical care was first rate and there was never a shortage of nurses to attend to me. I’ve defended the NHS to any critic. Free health care at the point of need seems to me the very essence of a caring community. ‘So what,’ I’ve said testily to people complaining about the wait in a clinic for a post-operative cancer check-up. ‘You’re getting top-class treatment for free! What have you got to whinge about?’ But now I’m worried that this precious service is in danger of imploding. Admittedly, my casualty experience at the Royal Free was faultless and, a week later, when I attend the fracture clinic, I have nothing to complain about. The wait was no more than half an hour, the X-ray pretty quick. The consultant recommended surgery. I was to be admitted on the Wednesday evening and was told to get my necessary blood tests done in advance. And that’s when the trouble started. The blood test queue filled a large waiting room and stretched, snake-like, along the corridor. My number was 365 — and 210 had just been called. It was two-and-a half hours before they got to me. Just as well I’d set the whole day aside. Wednesday came and I still had no information about when and where, or indeed if, I should turn up that evening. I called admissions. They hadn’t a clue. I emailed the surgeon’s secretary, and at 5pm I finally had a call. I was to arrive at the orthopaedic ward around 7.30pm. They’d finally found me a bed. The nurses could not have been more welcoming or attentive, but I soon learned that the chief nurse in the department had been on duty since 8am. It was now going on for 8.30pm, and when the consultant popped by, he casually suggested she might consider going home at some point. Jenni was diagnosed with a broken humerus, she has long been a supporter of the NHS especially after the care she received when she was suffering from breast cancer nearly ten years ago . I think the poor thing finally left around 10pm. I got the impression 14-hour shifts were far from unusual. The staff nurse who came to check me before lights out looked equally exhausted. He was Portuguese and told me he’d be the only qualified nurse on duty overnight, with the support of three or four health care assistants, in charge of 16 patients. Most of Thursday was a blur. Anaesthetic, surgery, recovery and then a room on the cardiac ward to monitor me overnight because no beds were available in orthopaedics. After a blissful night on morphine, I was moved to the general ward, still in the cardiac department, to be tended by a group of half a dozen nurses and health care assistants. They were rushed off their feet, making sure everyone — four in my room and a number of other bays — was washed, fed, watered and taken to the toilet. No patient was left wanting, but the staff looked as if they should be the ones in bed. And then there was Alice. She was in the next bed. She was in her late 70s, had suffered a heart attack and was obviously not in full control of her mental faculties. She shouted constant abuse at the nurses who tried their best for her. Jenni admitted that her casualty experience at the Royal Free (pictured) was faultless and, a week later, when she attended the fracture clinic, the wait was no more than half an hour . She was especially troublesome at night, so I and the other two women — a hotel proprietor from Blackpool with a rare heart condition and a quiet elderly woman — didn’t get much sleep. Alice’s finest hour came around 3am on my fifth and final night. She shouted more abuse at the nurses, insisting on getting out of bed. I got up and walked to the corridor for a break and a cup of hot chocolate, when a mug flew past my ears and smashed against the wall. More were thrown around the ward: Alice had been saving them up, hiding them who knows where, for a major assault. Three huge security men didn’t know what to do as she rampaged. I suggested to a distraught young nurse to call psychiatry. A doctor arrived after about half an hour — it’s a huge hospital — as we all looked on in horror at the sight of Alice losing it. She was given a drastic chemical cosh and it worked. I’m sure the young nurses are used to dealing with crises, but even they seemed shocked and at a loss to know how to deal with such violence. Next morning, when I woke and made my way to the loo, the Blackpool woman warned me: ‘Don’t go in there!’ At some point in the night, Alice had managed a dirty protest in the bathroom. She should never have been in a room with other patients. I don’t know why she wasn’t in a room of her own. Shortage of beds and staff again, I guess. When I left, I was discharged by a junior doctor who did not give me any paperwork to tell me what would happen next. I had to ping off another email to the consultant’s secretary again to find out. I needed the GP to trim stitches and should have physiotherapy after four weeks, she said. I wonder how many patients leave in ignorance because they don’t know who or how to ask? I will continue to support the principle of the NHS. I certainly won’t be arguing in favour of paying £5 to been seen in casualty, as some have suggested. Free at the point of need is what we are so proud to maintain. But investment in staff is unquestionably a priority. These nurses are desperate to do a good job, but there are too few of them to service the need. I would plead with anyone who feels ill to make their first port of call their GP so that emergency departments can do the job they’re set up to do; deal with emergencies. As for the shortage of beds, we must have effective social and convalescent care to end bed-blocking. And those overworked nurses? Let’s stop picking holes in this magnificent service we are privileged to have at our disposal, and say a collective thank you to those working so hard. Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope I don’t see any one of you again, for a long, long time, but you have my gratitude and admiration. I hope it sustains you through tonight’s 14-hour shift. Alice’s name has been changed.\n",

            "Washington (CNN)  -- A new book about former Sen. John Edwards paints him as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a daughter, risking his marriage and putting the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy -- all in the name of trying to win the presidency. In \"The Politician,\" former Edwards' aide Andrew Young details his efforts to conceal an ongoing extra-marital affair and the birth of a child out-of-wedlock. \"The Politician\" went on sale Saturday. Young described an elaborate plan that allowed Edwards to maintain a mistress while he sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. The plan was funded by two wealthy benefactors, the late trial lawyer Fred Baron and banking heir widow Bunny Mellon, but Mellon was unaware that her money was being used for the mistress. A federal grand jury is investigating payments the former senator's campaign and supporters made to Rielle Hunter, who was a videographer as Edwards was preparing a bid for 2008 White House run. In the book, Young writes that \"the prosecutors pressed me for exact information about checks that were written, the way the money was used and the timing of events. They wanted names, dates, and amounts in very specific terms.\" Young, who portrays himself as a one-time idealistic loyal aide, said he was the point person in arranging rendezvous for Edwards and Hunter and helped to keep the affair a secret. And when Edwards impregnated Hunter, Young said he agreed to the senator's request to lie and say he was the father even though Young, himself, was married with three children. Young said he told his wife about agreeing to Edwards' request as the couple drove through a McDonald's drive through to pick up food for their son. \"After I finally got to holler for Chicken McNuggets with chocolate milk and the right toy, I turned to Cheri and in the time it took us to reach window number one (where you give them the money), I said, 'Edwards wants me to say I'm the father of Rielle's baby, and then Fred's gonna fly us off to someplace where we can all hide,' \" Young said. His wife, Young recounted, was dumbfounded. \"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even tell me about this? Why didn't you just say no?\" Young said Hunter was also initially against the idea but warmed up to it after being told her financial needs would be met. His wife, Cheri, eventually agreed to the plan, setting in motion a chaotic time for the family as they uprooted their lives in North Carolina and criss-crossed the country with Hunter and their children in an effort to evade the media. Edwards denied that he was the girl's father for more than a year, saying the affair was over before Hunter became pregnant. Last week, he acknowledged paternity. \"I am Quinn's father,\" Edwards said in a statement. \"I have been able to spend time with her during the past year and trust that future efforts to show her the love and affection she deserves can be done privately and in peace.\" John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, have legally separated. On Friday, John Edwards' lawyers released a statement saying that early reports about the book indicate there are problems with Young's account. \"While we have not had an opportunity to view the interview or read the book, we urge extreme caution by everyone involved,\" his attorneys wrote. \"From media reports, it is obvious that there are many allegations which are simply false. It appears that Andrew Young is primarily motivated by financial gain and media attention.\" Earlier in the week, Elizabeth Edwards also challenged accusations Young made in the book regarding her cancer and the couple's children. \"Elizabeth is moving on with her life and wants to put this difficult chapter behind her,\" her publisher Random House said in a statement. \"It was an excrutiatingly (sic) painful period for her and she (has) no interest in rehashing the past. Based on the limited portions of the book that have been made available, it is clear it contains many falsehoods and exaggerations. \"She will not engage in a dialogue on each of the false charges, but would like to set the record straight on two key points. First, the allegation that she sought to politicize her cancer is unconscionable, hurtful and patently false. \"Second, she believed Andrew Young to be the father of this child until her husband confessed his paternity (sic) to her this past summer. She will have nothing further to say.\" In the book, Young accuses Elizabeth Edwards of engaging in a smear campaign to undermine his credibility. Young said it wasn't until John Edwards privately expressed indifference about the birth of his daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in February 2008, that he realized the former senator cared only about himself. \"After watching and hearing John Edwards practice a thousand little deceptions and tell a thousand different lies, ostensibly in the service of some greater good, I finally recognized that he didn't care about anyone other than himself,\" Young writes. \"A precious living, breathing human being -- his daughter -- had come into the world, and he wasn't inclined to even call the woman who had given birth to her. Instead, I had to prompt him to do the right thing, to do the most basic, human thing. \"My faith in him died almost instantly, and I felt both ashamed of my naïveté and very afraid for the future of my family.\" Young also writes that: . • He has a sex tape of Edwards in his possession showing the senator with a \"naked pregnant woman\" that Young says is Hunter. Young said he found the damaged tape in \"a box of trash that Rielle had left behind after she stayed with us for a few weeks\" in the Raleigh, North Carolina, home his family was renting. Young writes that even though the woman's face is obscured \"it was safe to assume it was Rielle.\" • Despite Edwards' carefully crafted image as a champion for everyday people, he was \"irritated by ordinary events. He especially hated making appearances at state fairs, where 'fat rednecks try to shove food down my face. I know I'm the people's senator, but do I have to hang out with them?'\" • Edwards understood his audience and before appearing at a Service Employees International Union health care event in Las Vegas, Nevada, he instructed Young to take his Italian suit coat to a tailor to remove the label indicating it was Italian-made. In its place, Edwards had the tailor sew in a \"Made in the USA\" label that had been on Young's jacket. • When Edwards was not on the Atkins diet, he \"loved Cracker Barrel\" restaurants as well as ribs. • Edwards thought that 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry \"just wasn't all that smart.\" Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, would later pick Edwards to be his vice presidential running mate.\n",
